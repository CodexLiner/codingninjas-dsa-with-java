        You are given the Trie class with following functions -
        1. insertWord
        2. removeWord
        Now, you need to create one more function (named "countWords" ) which returns the number of words currently present in Trie in O(1) time complexity.
        Note : You can change the already given functions in the Trie class, if required.*/
public class count_word_in_trie {
//    remaining code same as search word
    public int countWords() {
       // return numWords;
        return 0;
    }
}
